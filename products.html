              In marketing, a product is an object, or system, or service made
              available for consumer use as of the consumer demand; it is
              anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy the desire or
              need of a customer. In retailing, products are often referred to
              as merchandise, and in manufacturing, products are bought as raw
              materials and then sold as finished goods. A service is also
              regarded as a type of product.

                  <p>
                    Bellroy sells thinner-than-typical wallets. There's value to
                    that — but what is it, and how do you get the consumer to
                    understand it?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    To answer those questions, Bellroy divided its product page
                    into three stages of the buyer's journey — understanding the
                    problem, how to fix the problem, and how Bellroy can resolve
                    the problem.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    There's even an interactive section that shows how the
                    skinny wallet will fill up in comparison to standard
                    wallets. As users move a slider back and forth along a line,
                    both of the wallets fill up with cards and cash, visually
                    displaying the very problem Bellroy's skinny wallet solves.

                    Daily Harvest develops superfoods in the form of smoothies,
                    soups, and more, and delivers them to your doorstep. What
                    makes these foods' product pages so outstanding? They show
                    you exactly what makes these foods so super in a format
                    that's both clear and digestible — no pun intended.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Check out one of Daily Harvest's smoothie product pages,
                    below. Not only can you see what the smoothie looks like,
                    but hovering over the lefthand preview icon, below the main
                    image, shows you the foods used to create this drink. Scroll
                    down, and you'll see each ingredient and a simple
                    description of each one.
