              In marketing, a product is an object, or system, or service made
              available for consumer use as of the consumer demand; it is
              anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy the desire or
              need of a customer. In retailing, products are often referred to
              as merchandise, and in manufacturing, products are bought as raw
              materials and then sold as finished goods. A service is also
              regarded as a type of product.

                  An About Us page exists to share a business’ story and history
                  and provide a deeper connection with customers. Consumers want
                  to know the team behind the brand they are supporting. An
                  About Us page provides the perfect real estate to pull back
                  the curtain and reveal who is working behind the scenes. Most
                  importantly, though, an About Us page facilitates trust
                  between the consumer and the business. More than 33% of
                  consumers say that “trust” is a core factor when deciding
                  which businesses to support. With an About Us page, you can
                  begin to form an emotional relationship with customers and
                  engage with them on a deeper level.
