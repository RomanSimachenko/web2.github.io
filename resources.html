              In marketing, a product is an object, or system, or service made
              available for consumer use as of the consumer demand; it is
              anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy the desire or
              need of a customer. In retailing, products are often referred to
              as merchandise, and in manufacturing, products are bought as raw
              materials and then sold as finished goods. A service is also
              regarded as a type of product.

                  If resources are carelessly managed, many will be used up. If
                  used wisely and efficiently, however, renewable resources will
                  last much longer. Through conservation, people can reduce
                  waste and manage natural resources wisely. The population of
                  human beings has grown enormously in the past two centuries.
                  Billions of people use up resources quickly as they eat food,
                  build houses, produce goods, and burn fuel for transportation
                  and electricity. The continuation of life as we know it
                  depends on the careful use of natural resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The need to conserve resources often conflicts with other
                  needs. For some people, a wooded area may be a good place to
                  put a farm. A timber company may want to harvest the area’s
                  trees for construction materials. A business may want to build
                  a factory or shopping mall on the land. All these needs are
                  valid, but sometimes the plants and animals that live in the
                  area are forgotten. The benefits of development need to be
                  weighed against the harm to animals that may be forced to find
                  new habitats, the depletion of resources we may want in the
                  future (such as water or timber), or damage to resources we
                  use today.
